may need to install matplotlib, can do so using -
	'pip install matpoltlib'


you will need to execute the code in 'grapher.py' or 'grapheradv.py' using the python3 command or by some other code editing and executing application like VS Code

to clone this repo on you machine, use -

	'git clone https://github.com/ChefYeshpal/Grapher.git'


I have made this repo so that we can easily graph equations, trignometric functions, and points using our local device. The aim is to be able to identify and map data more easily and find out trends in it

to do;
	1. make it have multiple lines in one graph
	2. let it make waves with multiple trig functions
	3. should be able to use trig functions in equations too

this list will be updated, so points may get added or removed
